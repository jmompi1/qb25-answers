```{r setup, include=FALSE}
setwd("~/qb25-answers/week3")
library(stringr)
AF_df <- read_delim("~/qb25-answers/week3/AF.tsv", delim = "\t")

ggplot(AF_df, aes(x= Allele_Frequency)) +
  geom_histogram (bins = 11) +
  labs (x = "Allele Frequency") +
  labs (y = "Count") +
  labs (title = "Distribution of Allele Frequencies")

  
#This looks like a normal distribution. Majority of variants cluster around 50% frequency among the samples. I expect the distribution to present this way, since there is approximatley a 50% chance of each  parent passing a particular variant to their offspring.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
AF_df <- read.csv()
``

`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
