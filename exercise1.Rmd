## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

header <- c( "chr", "start", "end", "count" )
df_kc <- read_tsv("~/qb25-answers/week1/hg19-kc-count.bed", col_names=header )

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```
```{r}
#Plotting the gene density 

ggplot(df_kc, aes(x = df_kc$end, y = df_kc$count))+       
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(. ~ chr, scales ="free")

ggsave("exercise1.png")
?facet_wrap
?scales
```

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
