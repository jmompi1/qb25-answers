#(Ans 1.3) Examine the PCA plot. Does everything look okay (We wouldn’t ask if it did)?
#The points corresponding to each tissue do not seem to cluster together as I much as I expected. 

#(Ans #1.3) What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?
#Some of the tissues seem mismatched or incorrectly labeled (LFC.Fe and Fe)

#(Ans #3) For cluster 1, some of the most prominent biological processes are L-arginine biosynthesis, angiotensin maturation, fatty acid beta-oxidation using acyl-CoA oxidase, and organic anion transport. These are all metabolism-related processes, and it makes sense for them to be enriched. I can imagine there are specialized groups of cells in the midgut involved in nutrient uptake, which can include metabolizing fatty acids, carbohydrates, etc. In cluster 2, the major biological processes listed are chorion-containing egg shell formation. I would assume that because the development of egg shells takes place in the gut, and genes that promote this process would be specifically enriched in certain cells of the midgut compared to other cells.
