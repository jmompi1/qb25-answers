## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Step 1.1 — Load DNMs
#Load aau1043_dnm.csv into a tibble.
aau1043_dnm_df <- read_csv("~/qb25-answers/week5/aau1043_dnm.csv")


#Step 1.2 — Count DNMs by parental origin per proband
#Create a per-proband summary with counts of maternally and paternally inherited DNMs. Ignore DNMs without a specified parent of origin.
perproband_summary <- aau1043_dnm_df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Phase_combined)) %>%
  group_by(Proband_id) %>%
  summarise(
    num_maternal_inherited_dnms = sum(Phase_combined == "mother"),
    num_paternal_inherited_dnms = sum(Phase_combined == "father")
  )
    
print(perproband_summary)


#Step 1.3 — Load parental ages
#Load aau1043_parental_age.csv
aau1043_parental_age_df <- read_csv("~/qb25-answers/week5/aau1043_parental_age.csv")


#Step 1.4 — Merge counts with ages
#Join the two tibbles by proband ID.
aau1043_joined_df <- perproband_summary %>%
  left_join(aau1043_parental_age_df, by = "Proband_id")
print(aau1043_joined_df)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#PART 2
#Step 2.1 — Visualize relationships
#Create a scatter plot of the count of maternal DNMs vs. maternal age → save as ex2_a.png
maternaldnms_age <- ggplot(data = aau1043_joined_df, aes(x = Mother_age, y = num_maternal_inherited_dnms)) +
  geom_point()
  ggsave("ex2_a.png", plot = maternaldnms_age, path = "~/qb25-answers/week5")
  
#Create a scatter plot of the count of paternal DNMs vs. paternal age → save as ex2_b.png
paternaldnms_age <- ggplot(data = aau1043_joined_df, aes(x = Father_age, y = num_paternal_inherited_dnms)) +
  geom_point()
  ggsave("ex2_b.png", plot = paternaldnms_age, path = "~/qb25-answers/week5")

#Step 2.2 — OLS: maternal age vs. maternal DNMs
#Fit a simple linear regression model relating maternal age to the number of maternal de novo mutations.
lm(data = aau1043_joined_df, formula = num_maternal_inherited_dnms ~ 1 + Mother_age) %>%
  summary()

#In README.md, answer: 1. What is the “size” (i.e., slope) of this relationship? Interpret the slope in plain language. Does it match your plot? 2. Is the relationship significant? How do you know? Explain the p-value in plain but precise language.

#Ans (2.2): the slope is 0.3776, which is the degree to which the number of maternal inherited de novo mutations that can be explained by the moternal age. The points on the graph are more randomly distributed. The p-value is less than 2.2x10-16, which makes this relationship significant. There is a 2.2x10-16 probability that the spread of the number of maternally-inherited dnms is due to random chance.


#Step 2.3 — OLS: paternal age vs. paternal DNMs
#Repeat the step above but for paternal age vs. paternal DNMs.
lm(data = aau1043_joined_df, formula = num_paternal_inherited_dnms ~ 1 + Father_age) %>%
  summary()

#Ans (2.3): the slope here is 1.35384, which means there is a stronger correlation between father's age and the number of paternally-inherited dnms. This makes sense because the line seems more fitted. There is a 2.2x10-16 probability that the spread of the number of maternally-inherited dnms is due to random chance (p-value). 


#Step 2.4 — Predict for a 50.5-year-old father
#Use the paternal regression model to predict the expected number of paternal DNMs for a father of age 50.5. You are welcome to do this manually or using a built-in function, but show your work in README.md.
y = mx + b
num_paternal_inherited_dnms = father_age_slope * paternal_age + y-intercept
print((1.35384*50.2)+10.32632)

#Ans (2.4): expected number of paternal DNMs is 78.289 ~ 78.


#Step 2.5 — Compare distributions of maternal vs. paternal DNMs
#Plot both distributions on the same axes as semi-transparent histograms; save as ex2_c.png

png(file = "ex2_c.png")
step_2_hist <- hist(aau1043_joined_df$num_maternal_inherited_dnms, col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5), xlim = c(0,120), xlab = "inheritance of dnms", main="frequency of the number of maternally and paternally inherited dnms")
  hist(aau1043_joined_df$num_paternal_inherited_dnms, col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5), xlim = c(0,120), add=T, xlab = "inheritance of dnms")
#blue is paternal and pink is maternal
dev.off()
# I got the code from https://r-graph-gallery.com/. The main difference is the add=T, which makes the histograms transparent. 

#Ans (2.6): the mean difference in counts of maternal and paternal dnms is -39.23. On average, an individual will have about 39 more paternally-inherited de novo mutations compared to those that are maternally inherited. It seems to match the plot, because the maternal mean is around 10 and the paternal mean is around 50, so the difference is about 40, which is close to -39.23.The relationship is significant because the p-value is less than 2.2x10^-16.  The is less than a 2.2x10^-16 probability that the difference in means between maternally and paternally inherited dnms = -39.23 if the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis is that there is no mean difference between counts of maternal and paternal dnms. 

#running lm(diff ~1)
lm(data = aau1043_joined_df, num_maternal_inherited_dnms - num_paternal_inherited_dnms ~ 1)
#The coefficient for the intercept is -39.23, which is equal to what I got for the t test. I interpret this value as the baseline average difference between inherited de novo mutations from the maternal and paternal side. 


#Step 3.1 — Pick a TidyTuesday dataset
#Choose a dataset from the bottom of the TidyTuesday README. Record which one you chose in README.md.
#(Ans 3.1) I chose spotify_songs.csv

#Step 3.2 — Explore and visualize
#Generate figures and note any interesting patterns in README.md; save figures as ex4_<something>.png.
spotifysongs_df <- read_csv("~/qb25-answers/week5/spotify_songs.csv")

#total number of rows = 32833
#total number of unique artists represented = 10693
print(length(unique(spotifysongs_df$track_artist)))

#length of songs in general 
overall_track_lengths <- ggplot(spotifysongs_df, aes(x = duration_ms)) +
  geom_histogram()
  ggsave("ex4_overall_track_lengths.png", plot = overall_track_lengths, path = "~/qb25-answers/week5")

#comparing the length of songs in by genre
tracklength_genre <- ggplot(spotifysongs_df, aes(x = duration_ms)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap((. ~ playlist_genre))
  ggsave("ex4_tracklength_genre.png", plot = tracklength_genre, path = "~/qb25-answers/week5")
#all genres' track lengths have a peak of around 2e05ms. 

#comparing the tempo of songs by genre
tempo_genre <- ggplot(spotifysongs_df, aes(x = tempo)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap((. ~ playlist_genre))
  ggsave("ex4_tempo_genre.png", plot = tempo_genre, path = "~/qb25-answers/week5")
#edm songs are mostly within a very narrow range of tempo, compared to the other genres 

#how much does track length correlate with popularity?
lm(data = spotifysongs_df, formula = track_popularity ~ 1 + duration_ms) %>%
  summary()
#the estimate for track duration(ms) is -5.999e-5, which means track length was negatively correlated with popularity. As track length increases, popularity decreases. 

#how much does tempo correlate with popularity?
lm(data = spotifysongs_df, formula = track_popularity ~ 1 + tempo) %>%
  summary()
#the slope estimate is -.004994, which is a slight negative correlation between track tempo and popularity, but very miniscule. 

#danceability vs. popularity
lm(data = spotifysongs_df, formula = track_popularity ~ 1 + danceability) %>%
+   summary()
  

#Step 3.3 — Pose and test a linear-model hypothesis
#State a hypothesis, fit a linear model, evaluate fit, and report results in README.md.

#Null hypothesis: There is zero correlation or relationship between track duration and popularity. 
#Hypothesis: tracks with shorter lengths will be more popular. Track length are inversely correlated with popularity. 

lm(data = spotifysongs_df, formula = track_popularity ~ 1 + duration_ms) %>%
  summary()

#the estimate for track duration(ms) is -5.999e-5, which means track length was negatively correlated with popularity. As track length increases, popularity decreases.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
